                                                    arr+1 vs &arr+1

int arr[5] = {10,20,30,40,50};
Here,

arr is an integer pointer (int*) which points the first element of the array.
&arr is an integer array pointer (int*)[5] which points the whole array. (all five elements.)

        difference:

                       &arr + 1 	                                                             arr + 1

1. &arr is a pointer to an entire array.                                      1. arr is a pointer to the first element of the array.
   So, if we move &arr by 1 position it will point                               So, if we move arr by 1 position it will point the second element.
   the next block of 5 elements.
	
2. If the array base address is 1000, &arr+1 will be                          2.If the array base address is 1000, arr+1 will be 1000 + 4 which is 1004
	 1000 + (5 * 4) which is 1020



Example

#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

    printf("arr = %p \t arr+1 = %p\n",arr,arr+1);
    printf("&arr = %p \t &arr+1 = %p\n",&arr,&arr+1);

    return 0;
}
