There are 9 coins, all except one are the same weight, the odd one is heavier than the rest. 
You must determine which is the odd one out using an old fashioned balance(weighing machine). 
You may use the balance twice.
Explain how this can be done.

EXPLANATION:

MAKE 3 COINS AS ONE PAIR like
  pair 1: 1,2,3 coins
  pair 2: 4,5,6 coins
  pair 3: 7,8,9 coins 
  
    randomly place any two pair of coins in weighing machine and check it's weight.
    
    CASE : 1
    
    *if there weights are same,take third pair(which is not placed on weighing machine) of coins and pick randomly any two coins & place them in weighing
      machine and check coins weight ,if there weights are same, the remaining coin is odd one
      if the placed coins weights are different , then the high weight coin is the odd one.  
      
     CASE :2
     
      *if there weights are not same,then randomly pick one pair of coins in those two pairs,pick randomly any two coins & place them in weighing
      machine and check coins weight ,if there weights are same, the remaining coin is odd one
      if the placed coins weights are different , then the high weight coin is the odd one.
